# Kalki News 

## Innovation + Solutions

- We don't show car crashes, we show projects that fix road safety.
- We show pollution statistics, then we show the latest devices + projects to purify the air.
- Instead of food scandals, we show farmers, hydroponic experts, and restaurants making clean food.
- Instead of the stock market, we show the millions of dollars flowing through crowdfunding.
- We don't focus on politicians, we show engineers and builders. 

We focus 20% on the problem, then 80% on the solution. 

Look around, everything you see has been built by engineers. These people are not being shown on the news.

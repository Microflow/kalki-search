#TODO LISTS

This is a bare-bones readme with some simple TODO lists.

CSS
Kalki has to look lush. Our color scheme is teal, jade and indigo. We will later be diving into media queries to make the app responsive across multiple devices

JS
The code from the Microsoft example is a little brittle. For example, moving HTML elements around will cause the JS to break.
If you can fix this, please go ahead.

Bing results are less inspiring than Google's and we want to fix this. 

Our first JS adventure will be an experiment to see if we can serve lyrics to users in the same way that Google does. 

If you can do this, please go ahead.

# Kalki

Kalki is a prototype search engine that uses the Bing API. We're inspired by [Ecosia](www.ecosia.org). Ecosia give 80% of its profits to tree planting in Burkina Faso. [They've planted over 24 million trees](https://info.ecosia.org/).

## Priorities
- Fix colors: Search colors need to be different from google, with dark greens, but currently they are not easily readable. 
- Fix media queries: Kalki does not look good on all phones right now.
- Fix image search: Image search returns pics that are too small. [Ecosia's image serch looks good](https://www.ecosia.org/images?q=image+search)
- Make simple android wrapper to get into the play store:

We welcome contributions from front end programmers, beginners or advanced. Feel free to send a pull request.

The name [Kalki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalki) comes from the mythical Hindu warrior...

# TODO LISTS

This is a bare-bones readme with some simple TODO lists.

# CSS
Kalki has to look lush. Our color scheme is teal, jade and indigo. We will later be diving into media queries to make the app responsive across multiple devices

# JS
The code from the Microsoft example is a little brittle. For example, moving HTML elements around will cause the JS to break.
If you can fix this, please go ahead.

Bing results are less inspiring than Google's and we want to fix this. 

Our first JS adventure will be an experiment to see if we can serve lyrics to users in the same way that Google does. 

If you help add a lyric function, please go ahead.

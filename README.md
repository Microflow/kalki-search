# Kalki

Kalki is a prototype search engine that uses the Bing API. We're inspired by [Ecosia](www.ecosia.org). Ecosia give 80% of their profits to tree planting in Burkina Faso. [They've planted over 24 million trees](https://info.ecosia.org/).

## Roadmap, Spring 2018
- **Fix colors:** Search colors need to be different from google, with dark greens, but currently they are not easily readable. 
- **Fix media queries:** Kalki does not look good on all phones right now.
- **Fix image search:** Image search returns pics that are too small. [Ecosia's image serch looks good](https://www.ecosia.org/images?q=image+search). We want to build something similar. 
- **App:** Make a simple android or iOS app..
- **Serve song lyrics.** Our first JS adventure will be an experiment to see if we can serve lyrics to users in the same way that Google does. 

We welcome contributions from front end programmers, beginners or advanced. Feel free to send a pull request.

The name [Kalki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalki) comes from the mythical Hindu warrior...
